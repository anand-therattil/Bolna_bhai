Due to gas limitations, a trade may be split into multiple transactions, resulting in separate trade entities with a bucket_index and match_time field. These trade entities can be reconciled client-side by combining objects with the same market_order_id and match_time, and incrementing bucket_index.

Instruction: Explain how to fetch past trades on Polymarket and detail the various statuses a trade can have.
Response: Polymarket allows users to fetch all historical trades through the CLOB REST API. A trade is initiated when a 'taker' creates a marketable limit order, which can be matched against one or more resting limit orders on the associated order book.
